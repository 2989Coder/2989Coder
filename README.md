- 👋 Hi, I’m @2989Coder or Josef from Augsburg in Germany and currently 21 years old.
- 👀 I’m interested in protocol specifications and parsing/analyzing of data since this seems to be fun!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning c++ and almost everything else, because I am still unfamiliar with many concepts...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning new concepts and improving programming skills maybe in a coop project!
- 📫 How to reach me: - Discord: Sepp01#1040
